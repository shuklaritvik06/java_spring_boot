Microservices in Spring Boot typically follow a distributed architecture where each microservice is an independent, loosely coupled component. Here's an overview of key components in a Spring Boot microservices architecture:

1. **Service Registry (Eureka)**:
   - Centralized service registry for microservices.
   - Allows services to register and discover each other dynamically.

2. **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway/Zuul)**:
   - Acts as an entry point for clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices.
   - Handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and load balancing.

3. **Config Server**:
   - Centralized configuration management for microservices.
   - Provides a single source of truth for configuration settings, promoting consistency.

4. **Discovery Client**:
   - A client library enabling microservices to discover and interact with other services.
   - Retrieves service information from the registry and facilitates communication.

5. **Load Balancer**:
   - Distributes incoming requests across multiple instances of a microservice.
   - Enhances system reliability, scalability, and performance.
