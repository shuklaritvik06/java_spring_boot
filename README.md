This repository contains a collection of Spring Boot projects. Each project is a stand-alone, production-grade application built using Spring Boot framework.

## Overview

The repository is organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a different Spring Boot project. Each project directory contains the necessary source code, configuration files, and dependencies required to run the application.

## Project Structure

- Each Spring Boot project follows a standard structure, including the following components:

- Source Code: The source code files for the application are stored in the src directory. This includes Java classes, configuration files, and other resources required for the project.

- Dependencies: The project's dependencies are managed using a build tool such as Maven or Gradle. The build configuration file (pom.xml or build.gradle) lists all the required dependencies and their versions.
